# Assembly_Code_Substitution_Cipher
Assembly code implementation of a basic substitution cipher, where an input string is encrypted and decrypted using a predefined enciphering string. 

For encryption each letter of the input string is converted to its numeric equivalent (e.g: A = 1, B = 2,..., z = 26) and arithmetically added to the numeric equivelant of the enciphering text. 
 
The decryption is handled in the same way except arithmetic minus is used between the ciphertext and the enciphering string.
